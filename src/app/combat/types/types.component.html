		<h1>Combat types</h1>
		<p>
			There are two types of combat, each involving the same basic system with minor differences:
		</p>
		<h3>Close Combat:</h3>
		<p>
			This covers unarmed combat
			(Dexterity + Brawl) and melee (Dexterity + Melee).
			Unarmed combat can involve a down-and-dirty bar
			brawl or an honorable test of skill.
		</p>
		<p>
			Opponents must be
			within touching distance (one yard/meter) to engage
			in unarmed combat. Melee involves handheld weapons, from broken bottles to swords. Opponents must
			be within two yards/meters of each other to engage in
			melee.
		</p>
		<br>
		<h3>Ranged Combat:</h3>
		<p>
			Armed combat using projectile
			weapons â€” pistols, rifles, shotguns, etc. Opponents
			must normally be within sight (and weapon range) of
			each other to engage in a firefight.
