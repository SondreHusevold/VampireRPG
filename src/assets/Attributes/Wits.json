Characters with low Wits ratings are thick and mentally lethargic, or maybe gullible and unsophisticated. <br><br>By contrast, characters with high Wits Traits almost always have a plan immediately and adapt to their surroundings with striking expedience. Characters with high Wits also manage to keep their cool in stressful situations.",
