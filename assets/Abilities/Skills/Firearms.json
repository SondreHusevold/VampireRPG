So Cainites adapt, and many have devoted their energies to learning how to kill with guns. This Skill represents familiarity with a range of firearms, from holdout pistols to heavy machine guns. <br><br>Further, someone skilled in Firearms can clean, repair, recognize, and accurately fire most forms of small arms.
